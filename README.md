### Project Details

I successfully implemented the MVVM architecture in this project, leveraging ViewModels to handle UI-related logic and Repositories to abstract data sources. Additionally, I integrated Room Database for local data storage, extending its usage to support additional features.

This project serves as a practical application of the learned concepts, showcasing my understanding of MVVM architecture and Room Database in Android development.
