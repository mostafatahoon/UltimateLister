# Acknowledgments

This project was created following the [[MVVM Shopping List Tutorial](link-to-tutorial)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQkwcJG4YTCT0RouHZ6sQlE4JE6VyD2zO) by Philipp Lackner.
The tutorial covered essential concepts such as MVVM architecture and data persistence with Room Database.

I successfully implemented the MVVM architecture in this project, leveraging ViewModels to handle UI-related logic and Repositories to abstract data sources. Additionally, I integrated Room Database for local data storage, extending its usage to support additional features.

This project serves as a practical application of the learned concepts, showcasing my understanding of MVVM architecture and Room Database in Android development.
